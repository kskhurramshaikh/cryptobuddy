MARKET_EXPLANATION:
- Buyers control 66.2% of liquidity, but market is in LIQUIDITY_STRESSED regime.
- Momentum is weak (RSI 22.3, MACD_hist -643.6), with futures OI showing crowded longs.
- Nearest liquidation zones are tight ($86590-$86679), suggesting potential volatility.

SIGNAL_EVAL:
- Model signal: SELL, conviction 85
- LLM_AGREES: YES
- Reason: Weak momentum, stressed liquidity, and crowded longs align with SELL. SellScore (85) strongly outweighs buyScore (50).

IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS:
- Increase weight on futures bias (currently -7.82) given crowded longs.
- Add regime-specific thresholds for conviction (e.g., higher bar in LIQUIDITY_STRESSED).
- Incorporate tighter ATR windows (5m/15m) for liquidation zone sensitivity.
